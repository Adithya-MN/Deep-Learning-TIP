In fact, you're running a computer program, called a Jupyter Notebook, right now! It's a program that lets you write your own programs. How cool is that?\n",

They are the medium through which the computer understands what you want it to do. Think of them as the step between what you want to do and how you're going to tell the computer to do it. You may have heard of languages like Java and C++. Python is just like these. They may look different, but you can write programs to do the same things in different languages, just like we have different words in different spoken languages, for the same things.\n"
